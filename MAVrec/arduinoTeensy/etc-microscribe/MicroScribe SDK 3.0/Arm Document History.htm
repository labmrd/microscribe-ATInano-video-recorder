<h4 class="Header">Version 3.0</h4>
<p>This version of MicroScribe API contains functionality to support 64-bit application development. In addition, an extensive probe management example has been added that demonstrates application-ready probe management as well as how to connect to a MicroScribe with as specific serial number.</p>
<h4 class="Header">Version 2.3</h4>
<p>This version of MicroScribe API contains functionality to support USB-connected MicroScribe units multiply connected to a single host computer. 
In addition, the custom tip calibration algorithms have been made more robust to address tips of lengths very close to that of the master tip, and sample code has been documented herein enabling developers to implement the custom tip calibration functionality within their own applications. Registry access has also been widened to address user bases with limited access permissions.
</p>
<h4 class="Header">Version 2.2</h4>
<p>This version of MicroScribe API contains functions to support defining custom 
  tips, and saving these definitions for future or immediate use. </p>
<h4 class="Header">Version 2.1</h4>
<p>This version of the MicroScribe API contains the same functions as version 
  2.0 for the Windows Platform. New with version 2.1 is support for Mac OS X, 
  specifically 10.2. Since the API on the Mac can only connect to a MicroScribe 
  on the USB port, version 2.1 only supports MicroScribe G2s (or later versions) 
  and not the earlier MicroScribe-3D models. This technicall documentation has 
  been updated where necessary to describe the API's use on the Mac OS.</p>
 <h4 class="Header">Version 2.0</h4>
<p>This technical documentation applies to ArmDll32.dll version 2.0, the API/driver 
  for Immersion's MicroScribe product series. ArmDll32 version 2.0 was released 
  to coincide with the release of the MicroScribe G2 product.</p>
